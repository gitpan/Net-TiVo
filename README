ABSTRACT
    "Net::TiVo" provides an object-oriented interface to TiVo's XML/HTTPS
    interface. This makes it possible to enumerate the folders and shows,
    and dump their meta-data.

DESCRIPTION
    "Net::TiVo" has a very simple interface, and currently only supports the
    enumeration of folder and shows using the XML/HTTPS interface. The main
    purpose of this module was to provide access to the TiVo
    programmatically to automate the process of downloading shows from a
    TiVo.

  METHODS
    folders()
        Returns an array or reference to an array containing a list of
        Net::TiVo::Folder objects.

SEE ALSO
    Net::TiVo::Folder, Net::TiVo::Show
