SYNOPSIS
      use Net::TiVo;
        
      my $tivo = Net::TiVo->new(host => '192.168.1.25', mac => 'MEDIA_ACCESS_KEY');

      for my $folder ($tivo->folders()) {
          print "--->", $show->as_string(), "<---\n";
          for my $show ($folder->shows()) {

ABSTRACT
    "Net::TiVo" provides an object-oriented interface to TiVo's REST
    interface. This makes it possible to enumerate the folders and shows,
    and dump their meta-data.

DESCRIPTION
    "Net::TiVo" has a very simple interface, and currently only supports the
    enumeration of folder and shows using the XML/HTTPS interface. The main
    purpose of this module was to provide access to the TiVo
    programmatically to automate the process of downloading shows from a
    TiVo.

METHODS
    folders()
        Returns an array or reference to an array containing a list of
        Net::TiVo::Folder objects.

SEE ALSO
    Net::TiVo::Folder, Net::TiVo::Show
